Game requirements:
Please create a game similar to Flappy Bird in Unity. The art style is up to you. The quality and

pressing the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button.

which allows the player to restart the game as well as displaying the number of points
the player managed to score during the current attempt.

between game sessions.
- If a player has achieved a top-5 score they should be presented with a notification about
